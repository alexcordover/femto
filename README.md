# femto

Femto is a novel image compression methodology and related suite of tools designed at MHacks: Refactor. It was created to allow machine learning algorithms to run more efficiently on images by compressing them using pre-computed features. Further, the femto methodology can be reduced smaller than the size of a jpeg without sacrificing information and is transmissable by text, making it both lightweight and low overhead.

The femto suite includes an automated setup tool for Apache Spark (PySpark) and the SciPy stack on Linode servers, allowing distributed scientific computing using master and slave configurations on multiple machines.
